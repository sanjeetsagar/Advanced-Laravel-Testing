
### Checklist for Setting up and Running PHPUnit Tests in a Laravel Project

1.  Make sure PHPUnit is installed on your system by running `composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit` in your command line.
2.  In your Laravel project, create a new directory named `tests` in the root directory.
3.  In the `tests` directory, create a new file named `TestCase.php`.
4.  In the `TestCase.php` file, use the `use` statement to import the `Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\TestCase` class and extend it in your own `TestCase` class.
5.  In the `TestCase.php` file, override the `setUp` method to call the parent `setUp` method and also set up the test environment (e.g. set the base URL, set up the database, etc.).
6.  Create new test files in the `tests` directory, each file should have a name that corresponds to the class or feature that you're testing (e.g. `UserTest.php` for tests related to the `User` class).
7.  In each test file, use the `use` statement to import your `TestCase` class, and extend it in your own test class.
8.  Write test methods in each test file, Test methods should be named `test*`, where the `*` is a brief description of what the test does.
9.  Run your tests by running `phpunit` in your command line from the root of your laravel project.

## AssertSee, AssertSeeText, and AssertSeeInOrder Laravel Test

`AssertSee`, `AssertSeeText`, and `AssertSeeInOrder` are methods provided by the `Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\TestResponse` class, which is the base class for all test response objects in a Laravel application. These methods are used to make assertions about the content of the response when running tests.

1.  `AssertSee` method is used to check if the given string is present in the response.

```php
$response->assertSee('text to search');
```

2.  `AssertSeeText` method is used to check if the given string is present in the response, ignoring leading and trailing whitespace.

```php
$response->assertSeeText('text to search');`
```
3.  `AssertSeeInOrder` method is used to check if the given array of strings appears in the response in the given order.

```php
$response->assertSeeInOrder(['first string', 'second string']);`
```
## AssertStatus(200) VS AssertOk(), and Other Statuses

`assertStatus` and `assertOk` are methods provided by the `Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\TestResponse` class that are used to make assertions about the HTTP status code of the response when running tests.

1.  `assertStatus(200)` method is used to check if the HTTP status code of the response is equal to 200.

```php
$response->assertStatus(200);`
```
2.  `assertOk()` method is a shorthand method for `assertStatus(200)`. It is used to check if the HTTP status code of the response is equal to 200.

```php
$response->assertOk();`
```

## AssertInstanceOf

In a Laravel application, `assertInstanceOf` is a method provided by the `PHPUnit\Framework\Assert` class that is used to make an assertion about the type of an object when running tests.

```php
assertInstanceOf(Type::class, $object);`
```
It takes two arguments, the first is the expected class or interface of the object, and the second is the actual object. If the object is not an instance of the expected class or interface, the assertion will fail and the test will be marked as failed.

For example, if you have a class `Car` and you want to test that the returned object from a function is an instance of the `Car` class

```php
$car = new Car;
$this->assertInstanceOf(Car::class, $car);`
```
`assertInstanceOf` is useful for making sure that objects are of the correct type when running tests. It's important to note that this method only checks the type of the object and not its properties or methods.

# AssertStringStartsWith and Other String Assertions

In a Laravel application, `assertStringStartsWith` is a method provided by the `PHPUnit\Framework\Assert` class that is used to make an assertion about the starting of a string when running tests.

```php
assertStringStartsWith(string $prefix, string $string, string $message = '');
```

It takes three arguments, the first is the expected prefix of the string, the second is the actual string, and the third is an optional message that will be displayed if the assertion fails. If the actual string does not start with the expected prefix, the assertion will fail and the test will be marked as failed.

For example, if you want to test that a string starts with 'Hello'

```php
$this->assertStringStartsWith('Hello', 'Hello World');
```


Other String Assertions are:

*   `assertStringEndsWith(string $suffix, string $string, string $message = '')`
*   `assertStringContainsString(string $needle, string $haystack, string $message = '')`
*   `assertStringContainsStringIgnoringCase(string $needle, string $haystack, string $message = '')`
*   `assertStringMatchesFormat(string $format, string $string, string $message = '')`
*   `assertStringMatchesFormatFile(string $formatFile, string $string, string $message = '')`
*   `assertStringNotContainsString(string $needle, string $haystack, string $message = '')`
*   `assertStringNotContainsStringIgnoringCase(string $needle, string $haystack, string $message = '')`
*   `assertStringNotMatchesFormat(string $format, string $string, string $message = '')`
*   `assertStringNotMatchesFormatFile(string $formatFile, string $string, string $message = '')`

These methods are useful for making assertions about the contents of strings when running tests. You can use the appropriate method depending on the expected string content.

API Testing with Laravel
------------------------

Laravel provides several tools for testing API endpoints, including the ability to make JSON assertions. The most commonly used tool for this is the `assertJson` method, which can be used to check that a JSON response has a specific structure and/or values.

### AssertJson

The `assertJson` method can be used to check that the response from an API endpoint is a valid JSON string and that it matches a given set of criteria. The method takes an array of criteria as its first argument, and an optional second argument that allows you to check for specific values within the JSON.

Here is an example of using `assertJson` to check that a response from an API endpoint contains a specific value:

```php
$response = $this->get('/api/users');
$response->assertJson(['name' => 'John Doe']);
```

In this example, the `assertJson` method is checking that the response from the `/api/users` endpoint includes a JSON object with a `name` key that has the value "John Doe".

You can also use `assertJson` to check that the response contains a specific structure:

```php
$response = $this->get('/api/users');
$response->assertJson([
    'data' => [
        [
            'name' => 'John Doe',
            'email' => 'johndoe@example.com',
        ],
        [
            'name' => 'Jane Doe',
            'email' => 'janedoe@example.com',
        ],
    ],
]);

```

In this example, the `assertJson` method is checking that the response from the `/api/users` endpoint includes a JSON object with a `data` key that contains an array of two objects, each with a `name` and `email` key.

### Other JSON Assertions

In addition to `assertJson`, Laravel provides several other methods for making JSON assertions:

*   `assertJsonMissing`: Asserts that the response does not contain a specific key or value.
*   `assertJsonMissingExact`: Asserts that the response does not contain an exact match for a specific JSON structure.
*   `assertJsonFragment`: Asserts that the response contains a specific subset of keys and values.
*   `assertJsonStructure`: Asserts that the response has a specific structure, without checking for specific values.

It's also worth noting that there are more powerful 3rd party packages like `Dingo/Api` that provides more functionality that can aid in testing your API.


# AssertDatabaseHas or Eloquent AssertModelExists?

AssertDatabaseHas and Eloquent AssertModelExists are both methods used in testing to check if a specific record exists in the database.

### AssertDatabaseHas

`AssertDatabaseHas` is a method provided by the `Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\Concerns\InteractsWithDatabase` trait. It allows you to check if a specific record exists in the database table, by providing the table name and an array of conditions to match.

```php
$this->assertDatabaseHas('users', [
    'email' => 'john@example.com',
    'votes' => 100
]);
```

### Eloquent AssertModelExists

`Eloquent AssertModelExists` is a method provided by the `Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\Concerns\InteractsWithDatabase` trait. It allows you to check if a specific model exists in the database.

```php
$user = User::create([
    'email' => 'john@example.com',
    'votes' => 100
]);
$this->assertModelExists($user);
```


In summary, both methods are used to check if a specific record exists in the database, but `AssertDatabaseHas` allows you to check if a specific record exists based on conditions, while `Eloquent AssertModelExists` allows you to check if a specific model instance exists in the database.


# How to Assert File Downloads?

There are a few different ways to assert that a file download is working correctly in a test, depending on the framework and testing library you are using. Here is an example of how to do this using the `PHPUnit` testing framework and the `Symfony` HttpClient:

```php
use Symfony\Component\HttpClient\HttpClient;

public function testDownloadFile()
{
    $client = HttpClient::create();
    $response = $client->request('GET', 'http://example.com/downloads/file.zip');

    // Assert that the response status code is 200 (OK)
    $this->assertEquals(200, $response->getStatusCode());

    // Assert that the Content-Type header is 'application/zip'
    $this->assertEquals('application/zip', $response->getHeaders()['content-type'][0]);

    // Assert that the Content-Disposition header contains the correct filename
    $this->assertStringContainsString('attachment; filename="file.zip"', $response->getHeaders()['content-disposition'][0]);

    // Assert that the content of the response is the contents of the file
    $this->assertEquals(file_get_contents('path/to/file.zip'), $response->getContent());
}
```

This example uses the `Symfony\Component\HttpClient\HttpClient` to send a GET request to the download URL, and then uses `PHPUnit` assertions to check that the response has a status code of 200 (OK), the correct `Content-Type` and `Content-Disposition` headers, and that the contents of the response match the contents of the expected file.

You can also use `laravel-http-testing` package to assert file downloads in laravel, this package provides a few useful methods to assert file downloads.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

public function testDownloadFile()
{
    $response = Http::get('http://example.com/downloads/file.zip');

    // Assert that the response status code is 200 (OK)
    $response->assertOk();
    // Assert that the response contains the correct headers
    $response->assertHeader('content-type', 'application/zip');
    $response->assertHeader('content-disposition', 'attachment; filename="file.zip"');
}
```

In summary, the way to assert file downloads will vary depending on the framework and testing library you are using. But you can use similar methods as shown above to assert if a file is downloaded correctly.

# All Assertions List and What If You Don't Find The Right Assertion?

There are many different types of assertions that you can use when writing tests, depending on the testing framework and library you are using. Here are some common assertions that are available in most testing frameworks:

*   `assertTrue` / `assertFalse`: Check if a given value is `true` or `false`.
*   `assertEquals` / `assertNotEquals`: Check if two values are equal (or not equal) to each other.
*   `assertNull` / `assertNotNull`: Check if a value is `null` or not `null`.
*   `assertContains` / `assertNotContains`: Check if a value is contained (or not contained) within an array or string.
*   `assertCount`: Check if an array or countable object has a specific number of items.
*   `assertEmpty` / `assertNotEmpty`: Check if a value is empty or not empty.
*   `assertRegExp` / `assertNotRegExp`: Check if a string matches (or does not match) a regular expression.
*   `assertGreaterThan` / `assertLessThan`: Check if a value is greater than or less than another value.

But sometimes these assertions are not enough for your specific test cases. In that case, you can use the `fail` method to create a custom assertion. For example:

```php
public function testMyCustomAssertion()
{
    $value = ...;
    if (! myCustomAssertion($value)) {
        $this->fail('My custom assertion failed');
    }
}
```

You can also create your own custom assertion methods. For example:

```php
public function assertMyCustomAssertion($value)
{
    if (! myCustomAssertion($value)) {
        $this->fail('My custom assertion failed');
    }
}
```

In summary, there are many built-in assertions available in most testing frameworks, but if you don't find the right assertion for your specific test case, you can use the `fail` method or create your own custom assertion method to handle it.



# Pick Assertions with Right Error Messages

When writing tests, it's important to choose the right assertion method and provide meaningful error messages in case the test fails. Here are some examples of how to choose the right assertion method and provide helpful error messages:

*   `assertEquals`: Use this method to check if two values are equal to each other. Provide a meaningful error message that includes the expected and actual values.

```php
$expected = 'apple';
$actual = 'orange';
$this->assertEquals($expected, $actual, 'The expected value is '.$expected.' but the actual value is '.$actual);
```

*   `assertContains`: Use this method to check if a value is contained within an array or string. Provide a meaningful error message that includes the expected value and the array or string being searched.

```php
$needle = 'banana';
$haystack = ['apple', 'orange', 'mango'];
$this->assertContains($needle, $haystack, $needle.' was not found in '.json_encode($haystack));
```

*   `assertGreaterThan`: Use this method to check if a value is greater than another value. Provide a meaningful error message that includes the values being compared.

```php
$value1 = 5;
$value2 = 10;
$this->assertGreaterThan($value1, $value2, $value1.' is not greater than '.$value2);
```

*   `assertNull`: Use this method to check if a value is null. Provide a meaningful error message that includes the variable name or value being checked.

```php
$value = null;
$this->assertNull($value, $value.' is not null');`
```
In summary, when choosing the right assertion method, you should consider what you are trying to test, and what would be a meaningful error message in case the test fails. Providing meaningful error messages will make it easier to understand what went wrong when a test fails, and how to fix the issue.


# How to Test Different Features
# 
## Testing for Specific Exceptions
When testing a piece of code that is expected to throw an exception, it's important to test that the correct exception is thrown and with the expected message. Here is an example of how to test for a specific exception using the `PHPUnit` testing framework:

```php
use PHPUnit\Framework\ExpectationFailedException;

public function testThrowsException()
{
    $this->expectException(ExpectationFailedException::class);
    $this->expectExceptionMessage('This is my expected exception message');
   
    // Code that is expected to throw an exception
    throw new ExpectationFailedException('This is my expected exception message');
}
```

The `expectException` method is used to specify the type of exception that is expected to be thrown, and the `expectExceptionMessage` method is used to specify the expected exception message.

In this example, the test fails if the code does not throw an `ExpectationFailedException` with the message "This is my expected exception message".

In case you want to test for multiple exceptions you can use `expectException` and `expectExceptionMessage` multiple times in your test function.

```php
public function testThrowsException()
{
    $this->expectException(ExpectationFailedException::class);
    $this->expectExceptionMessage('This is my expected exception message');
    $this->expectException(InvalidArgumentException::class);
    $this->expectExceptionMessage('Invalid Argument provided');

    // Code that is expected to throw an exception
    throw new ExpectationFailedException('This is my expected exception message');
    throw new InvalidArgumentException('Invalid Argument provided');
}
```

It is also possible to test for exceptions using the `try` `catch` block, like this:

```php
public function testThrowsException()
{
    try {
        // Code that is expected to throw an exception
        throw new ExpectationFailedException('This is my expected exception message');
    } catch (ExpectationFailedException $e) {
        $this->assertEquals('This is my expected exception message', $e->getMessage());
    }
}
```

In summary, when testing for specific exceptions it is important to specify the expected exception type and message, this way you can be sure that the code is throwing the right exception, and that the exception message is the expected one. This helps to identify the source of the problem in case the test fails.

## How To Test Artisan Commands
Artisan commands are classes that can be run from the command line to perform various tasks in a Laravel application. Here is an example of how to test an Artisan command using the `Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\Concerns\InteractsWithConsole` trait in a PHPUnit test:

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\Concerns\InteractsWithConsole;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Artisan;

class MyCommandTest extends TestCase
{
    use InteractsWithConsole;

    public function testCommand()
    {
        $this->withoutMockingConsoleOutput();

        // Run the command and capture the output
        $output = Artisan::call('my-command');

        // Assert that the command output matches expected output
        $this->assertEquals('Command ran successfully!', $output);
    }
}
```
The `InteractsWithConsole` trait provides methods for interacting with the console, such as `withoutMockingConsoleOutput` method, this method allows you to run the command without mocking the console output.

The `Artisan::call` method is used to run the command, and its output is captured in the `$output` variable. You can then use assertions, like `assertEquals` to check if the output matches what you expect.

You can also use the `Artisan::queue` method to queue the command to be run in the future, this is useful when you want to test commands that are executed as a background job.

```php
Artisan::queue('my-command')->onQueue('high');`
```
It's also possible to test if a command was dispatched by using `assertCommandDispatched` method provided by `InteractsWithConsole` trait:

```php
$this->assertCommandDispatched('my-command');`
```
You can also test if the command was dispatched with the expected arguments by chaining the with method:


```php
$this->assertCommandDispatched('my-command')->with('arg1', 'arg2');`
```
In summary, when testing Artisan commands, you can use the `InteractsWithConsole` trait provided by Laravel to run the command and capture its output, which can then be asserted against expected output. You can also test if a command was dispatched and with expected arguments. This allows you to ensure that your commands are working as expected.


## Testing Eloquent Observers/Attributes
Eloquent observers and attributes are classes that allow you to add additional functionality to your Eloquent models, such as automatically setting or modifying attribute values, or triggering events when certain actions are performed on the model. Here is an example of how to test an Eloquent observer using the `PHPUnit` testing framework:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use App\Observers\UserObserver;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Event;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

class UserObserverTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;

    public function setUp(): void
    {
        parent::setUp();

        User::observe(UserObserver::class);
    }

    public function testCreatingUser()
    {
        Event::fake();

        $user = new User;
        $user->name = 'John Doe';
        $user->save();

        Event::assertDispatched('eloquent.created: App\Models\User', function ($event, $users) use ($user) {
            return $users->id === $user->id;
        });
    }

    public function testUpdatingUser()
    {
        Event::fake();
        $user = factory(User::class)->create();
        $user->name = 'Jane Doe';
        $user->save();

        Event::assertDispatched('eloquent.updated: App\Models\User', function ($event, $users) use ($user) {
            return $users->id === $user->id;
        });
    }

    public function testDeletingUser()
    {
        Event::fake();
        $user = factory(User::class)->create();
        $user->delete();

        Event::assertDispatched('eloquent.deleted: App\Models\User', function ($event, $users) use ($user) {
            return $users->id === $user->id;
        });
    }
}
```
In this example, the `User` model is observed by the `UserObserver` class using the `observe` method. Then, we use the `Event` facade to fake the events that should be dispatched when creating, updating, and deleting a user. In each test we create, update and delete the user, and use `Event::assertDispatched` method to assert that the corresponding event was dispatched, and that the model passed as an argument to the event is the same as the model that was created, updated or deleted.

To test attributes you can use the `assertEquals` method to check that the attribute is set with the expected value. For example, for testing the `full_name` attribute in user model:

```php
$user = new User;
$user->first_name = 'John';
$user->last_name = 'Doe';
$user->save();

$this->assertEquals('John Doe', $user->full_name);
```
In summary, when testing Eloquent observers and attributes you can use the `Event::assertDispatched` method to test that the expected events are triggered, and you can use the `assertEquals` method to check that the attribute is set with the expected value. This allows you to ensure that your observers and attributes are working as expected.

## How to Test Job Classes
Job classes in Laravel are used to perform tasks asynchronously in the background. Here is an example of how to test a job class using the `PHPUnit` testing framework and the `Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\Concerns\InteractsWithQueue` trait:

```php
use App\Jobs\MyJob;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\Concerns\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

class MyJobTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase, InteractsWithQueue;

    public function testHandle()
    {
        $this->withoutExceptionHandling();

        $job = new MyJob();
        $this->assertNull($job->handle());
        $this->assertTrue($job->hasFailed());
        $this->assertCount(1, $job->failures());
    }
}
```
In this example, the `MyJob` class is being tested. The `handle` method is called and then the `hasFailed` and `failures` methods are used to check if the job failed and if there are any failures.

You can also use the `assertJobDispatched` method provided by `InteractsWithQueue` trait to test if a job was dispatched:

```php
$this->assertJobDispatched(MyJob::class);
```
You can also test if the job was dispatched with the expected arguments by chaining the with method:

```php
$this->assertJobDispatched(MyJob::class, function (MyJob $job) {
    return $job->arg1 === 'value1' && $job->arg2 === 'value2';
});
```
It's also possible to test the job and check if it has been dispatched and executed by using `dispatch` method provided by `InteractsWithQueue` trait.

```php
$this->dispatch(new MyJob());
$this->assertJobExecuted(MyJob::class);
```
In summary, when testing job classes you can use the `InteractsWithQueue`

##  HTTP Request with Redirects: Check the FINAL Response
When making HTTP requests that include redirects, it's important to test that the final response is as expected. Here is an example of how to test an HTTP request with redirects using the `Laravel` `HTTP Testing` tools:

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\Concerns\InteractsWithRedirects;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\Concerns\InteractsWithExceptionHandling;

class MyTest extends TestCase
{
    use InteractsWithRedirects, InteractsWithExceptionHandling;

    public function testRedirect()
    {
        $response = $this->get('/redirect');

        // Assert that the final response is a redirect to the expected URL
        $response->assertRedirect('/redirected');

        // Assert that the final response is a redirect with a specific status code
        $response->assertRedirect('/redirected', 301);

        // Assert that the final response is a redirect to a named route
        $response->assertRedirect(route('redirected'));

        // Assert that the final response is a redirect to an action
        $response->assertRedirect(action('RedirectedController@index'));

        // Assert that the final response is a redirect and follow the redirect
        $response->assertRedirect('/redirected')
                  ->followRedirect()
                  ->assertSee('This is the redirected page');
    }
}
```
In this example, the `get` method is used to make an HTTP GET request to the `/redirect` endpoint. The `assertRedirect` method is then used to test that the final response is a redirect to the expected URL, with a specific status code, or to a named route or an action. Additionally, the `followRedirect` method is used to follow the redirect, and the `assertSee` method is used to check that the final response contains the expected text.

Note that you can also use `post`, `patch`, `put`, `delete`, `json` methods to make different kind of requests and follow redirects.

In summary, when testing HTTP requests that include redirects, it's important to test that the final response is as expected, and you can use the `Laravel` `HTTP Testing` tools to test the final response, such as the `assertRedirect` and `followRedirect` methods, and also you can use the `assertSee` method to check that the final response contains the expected text. This allows you to ensure that your application is handling redirects correctly.

# Random Testing Tips
#
## Customize Default make:test Templates/Stubs
In Laravel, the `make:test` command is used to generate new test classes. By default, this command will create a new test file with a predefined template. However, it is possible to customize the template used by this command to suit your needs.

There are two ways to customize the default template for the `make:test` command:

1.  **Customizing the template directly:** You can customize the default template by editing the `stubs/tests/test.stub` file located in the root directory of your Laravel application. This file contains the default template used by the `make:test` command. You can make any desired changes to this file, such as adding new methods, and they will be reflected in the test files generated by the command.
    
2.  **Creating a custom stub:** You can create a custom stub file and specify it when running the `make:test` command. This can be done by creating a new file with the desired template in the `stubs` directory of your Laravel application. For example, if you create a file named `mytest.stub` in this directory, you can use it as the template for the `make:test` command by running `php artisan make:test MyTest --stub=mytest`.
    
Example : 
```php
 php artisan make:test MyTest --stub=customTest`
```
Note that in both cases, you will need to re-run the `make:test` command after making changes to the template to see the changes in the generated test files.

It is also possible to use external tools like [bex/laravel-test-tools](https://github.com/bex/laravel-test-tools) to customize the test templates, which provide an easy way to customize the default test templates.

## Stop on the First Error, or Skip Certain Tests.

When running tests, it can be useful to have the ability to stop the execution of the tests on the first error, or to skip certain tests.

### Stopping on the first error

In PHPUnit, there is a command line option `--stop-on-failure` that will cause the test runner to stop executing tests as soon as a failure occurs. This can be useful when debugging a test suite, as it allows you to focus on the first test that failed instead of having to sift through multiple failed tests.

Example: 
```php
./vendor/bin/phpunit --stop-on-failure
```
### Skipping certain tests
There are different ways to skip certain tests in PHPUnit:

*   **Marking test as skipped:** You can use the `$this->markTestSkipped()` method in the test case to mark a test as skipped. This will cause the test runner to skip the test and not report it as a failure.
Example:

```php
public function testSomething()
{
    if (!extension_loaded('soap')) {
        $this->markTestSkipped('The SOAP extension is not available.');
    }

    // ...
}

```

*   **Marking test as incomplete:** You can use the `$this->markTestIncomplete()` method in the test case to mark a test as incomplete. This will cause the test runner to skip the test and report it as incomplete.

```php
Example:
public function testSomething()
{
    if (!extension_loaded('soap')) {
        $this->markTestIncomplete('The SOAP extension is not available.');
    }

    // ...
}
```
*   **Using annotations:** You can use annotations to skip certain tests. PHPUnit supports the `@medium`, `@large`, `@group`, `@depends`, `@expectedException`, `@dataProvider`, `@expectedExceptionCode`, `@expectedExceptionMessage`, `@expectedExceptionMessageRegExp`, and `@test` annotations.

Example:
```php
/**
 * @group group1
 */
 public function testSomething(){
   //...
 }
```
This test will be run only if you specify the group while running the test.

Example: 
```php
./vendor/bin/phpunit --group=group1
```
You can use any of these methods to skip certain tests based on your needs.


## Response Debugging: Dump and Die

In Laravel, the `dd()` function is a useful tool for debugging and troubleshooting tests. It allows developers to quickly inspect the value of a variable or expression, and it terminates the execution of the test immediately after the output is displayed.

When using `dd()` in Laravel tests, it can be used to debug the response of an API endpoint or view.

Here is an example of using `dd()` to debug the response of an API endpoint:

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;

    public function test_example()
    {
        // Set up test data
        $data = [
            'name' => 'John',
            'age' => 30,
        ];

        // Send a request to the API endpoint
        $response = $this->json('POST', '/api/example', $data);

        // Inspect the response
        dd($response->getContent());
    }
}
```
In this example, the `dd()` function is used to inspect the content of the response from the API endpoint. The `getContent()` method is used to get the raw response content as a string, which is then passed to the `dd()` function for inspection.

It is important to note that the `dd()` function is intended for debugging and troubleshooting, and it should be used sparingly in production code, as it may cause the test to terminate unexpectedly. Instead of using `dd()` function, you can use `dump()` function which only dump the content to the browser or console but not stop the execution of the test.

Additionally, it's also a good practice to clean the test cases after debugging.

It is also important to note that in Laravel, the `dd()` function is a global helper function that is made available by the framework.

In the case of testing the views, the `dump()` function can be used to inspect the variables passed to the view.

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;

    public function test_example()
    {
        // Set up test data
        $data = [
            'name' => 'John',
            'age' => 30,
        ];

        // Send a request to the view
        $response = $this->get('/example', $data);

        // Inspect the response
        $response->assertViewIs('example');
        $response->assertViewHas('name', 'John');
        dump($response->original);
    }
}
```
In this example, the `dump()` function is used to inspect the variables passed to the view. The `original` property is used to get the original response data, which is then passed to the `dump()` function for inspection.


## setUp, setUpBeforeClass and Parent TestCase

In PHPUnit, test cases are defined as classes that contain test methods. These classes can be organized into a hierarchy to share common functionality between test cases.

### setUp()

The `setUp()` method is a method in PHPUnit that is run before each test method in the test case class. This method is used to set up any necessary data or dependencies for the test method to run correctly. The `setUp()` method is called before each test method, so it can be used to set up common data or reset state that is modified during the test.

```php
class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    protected $example;

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        parent::setUp();
        $this->example = new Example();
    }

    public function testSomething()
    {
        $this->assertTrue($this->example->something());
    }
}
```
In this example, the `setUp()` method is used to create a new instance of the `Example` class, which is used by the `testSomething()` method.

### setUpBeforeClass()

The `setUpBeforeClass()` method is a method in PHPUnit that is run once before all test methods in the test case class are run. This method is used to set up any necessary data or dependencies for the test methods to run correctly. The `setUpBeforeClass()` method is called only once for the entire test case class, so it can be used to set up data that is shared between test methods.

```php
class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    protected static $example;

    public static function setUpBeforeClass(): void
    {
        self::$example = new Example();
    }

    public function testSomething()
    {
        $this->assertTrue(self::$example->something());
    }

    public function testSomethingElse()
    {
        $this->assertFalse(self::$example->somethingElse());
    }
}
```
In this example, the `setUpBeforeClass()` method is used to create a new instance of the `Example` class, which is shared between the `testSomething()` and `testSomethingElse()` methods.

### Parent TestCase

A test case class can extend from another test case class, which is known as a parent test case. A parent test case can contain common functionality that is shared between test cases. This can include shared data, shared set up and tear down methods, and shared assertion methods.

```php
class ParentTestCase extends TestCase
{
    protected $example;

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        parent::setUp();
        $this->example = new Example();
    }

    public function assertTrue($condition)
    {
        return $this->assertTrue($condition);
    }

}

class ExampleTest extends ParentTestCase
{
    public function testSomething()
    {
        $this->assertTrue($this->example->something());
    }
}
```
In this example, the `ParentTestCase` is a parent test case that contains a shared instance of the `Example` class and a shared assertion method `assertTrue()`. The `ExampleTest` class extends from the `ParentTestCase`, so it can access the shared instance of the `Example` class and the shared assertion method.

## View Errors Differently: withoutExceptionHandling()
In Laravel, when an exception is thrown during a request, the framework will catch it and display an error page to the user. However, this can make it difficult to debug and troubleshoot the exception when writing tests, as the error page does not provide much information about the cause of the exception.

To help with this, Laravel provides a method `withoutExceptionHandling()` that can be used to disable the exception handling during a test. This method can be used to disable the exception handling for a single test or for all tests in a test case.

Here is an example of using `withoutExceptionHandling()` to disable exception handling for a single test:

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;

    public function test_example()
    {
        $this->withoutExceptionHandling();
        // Test code that may throw an exception
    }
}
```
When the exception handling is disabled, any exception that is thrown during the test will be passed through to PHPUnit, which will display the full stack trace and any other relevant information about the exception. This can make it much easier to debug and troubleshoot the exception.

It is important to note that `withoutExceptionHandling()` method should be used sparingly, as it may cause the test to fail in an unexpected way. It is best to only use it when you are trying to debug a specific issue, and then remove it once the issue has been resolved.

Additionally, Laravel also provides `withExceptionHandling()` method, which can be used to re-enable the exception handling after it has been disabled with the `withoutExceptionHandling()` method.

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;

    public function test_example()
    {
        $this->withoutExceptionHandling();
        // Test code that may throw an exception
        $this->withExceptionHandling();
    }
}
```
It is important to note that, when using the `withoutExceptionHandling()` method, your test should not be expecting an exception, instead it should be expecting an error page.

## Create a Totally Custom Factory Class 

In Laravel, factories are used to generate fake data for testing purposes. The built-in factory classes provided by Laravel can be used to generate data for most of the models in the application, but sometimes it may be necessary to create a totally custom factory class for a specific model.

Here is an example of how to create a custom factory class for a `User` model:

1.  Create a new directory `database/factories` if it does not exist.
2.  Create a new file `UserFactory.php` in the `database/factories` directory.
3.  Add the following code to the `UserFactory.php` file:

```php
<?php

use App\User;
use Faker\Generator as Faker;

$factory->define(User::class, function (Faker $faker) {
    return [
        'name' => $faker->name,
        'email' => $faker->unique()->safeEmail,
        'password' => '$2y$10$TKh8H1.PfQx37YgCzwiKb.KjNyWgaHb9cbcoQgdIVFlYg7B77UdFm', // secret
        'remember_token' => str_random(10),
    ];
});
```
In this example, the `define()` method is used to define the factory for the `User` model. The first argument passed to the `define()` method is the class name of the model, and the second argument

## Arrange - Act - Assert: Multiple Times in One Method?
Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) is a common pattern used in unit testing to separate the setup, execution, and validation of a test. The pattern consists of three steps:

1.  **Arrange**: In this step, the test sets up the necessary data and dependencies for the test. This includes creating objects, setting up test data, and any other necessary setup.
    
2.  **Act**: In this step, the test performs the action that it is testing. This could be a method call, a user action, or any other type of execution.
    
3.  **Assert**: In this step, the test asserts that the expected outcome occurred. This includes validating the return value, checking the state of the system, or any other type of validation.
    

It's common to have multiple AAA in one method when you're testing different scenarios or variations of the same functionality.

```php
class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_example()
    {
        // Arrange
        $example = new Example();

        // Act and Assert
        $this->assertTrue($example->something());

        // Arrange
        $example = new Example();
        $example->setValue(5);

        // Act and Assert
        $this->assertEquals(5, $example->getValue());

        // Arrange
        $example = new Example();
        $example->setValue(-5);

        // Act and Assert
        $this->assertEquals(-5, $example->getValue());
    }
}
```
In the above example, there are three AAA blocks in the `test_example()` method. Each block tests a different scenario of the `Example` class. The first block tests the `something()` method, the second block tests the `setValue()` and `getValue()` method when the value is positive, and the third block tests the `setValue()` and `getValue()` method when the value is negative.

It is a good practice to keep the test method to test one scenario and it should be focused on one single responsibility.

It is also important to note that, having multiple AAA in one method makes the test less readable and harder to troubleshoot when the test fails. In general, it is recommended to have one AAA block per test method, and if it's needed to test multiple scenarios or variations of the same functionality, it's better to write multiple test methods each one of them should focus on one scenario.

# Faking and Mocking Classes
#

## "Fake" Time: Travel in Time to Reproduce Test Scenarios

In some cases, it may be necessary to test how a system behaves under different time conditions. For example, you may want to test how a system behaves when a certain action is taken during a specific time of the day, or how it behaves when a certain time period has passed.

To test these scenarios, you can "fake" the time by traveling in time during a test. This can be done by using a library like `mockery/mockery` or `mockery/mockery-time` to replace the built-in `date` and `time` functions with custom implementations that return a specific time during the test.

Here is an example of how to use the `mockery/mockery-time` library to "fake" the time during a test:

```php
use Carbon\Carbon;
use Mockery as m;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_example()
    {
        // Set the current time to a specific date and time
        Carbon::setTestNow(Carbon::parse('2022-10-10 10:10:10'));

        // Test code that uses the current time
    }

    public function tearDown(): void
    {
        m::close();
        Carbon::setTestNow();
    }
}
```
In this example, we use the `setTestNow()` method provided by the `Carbon` class to set the current time to a specific date and time. This will make all calls to `date`, `time`, `now`, etc. return the specified time during the test.

Once the test is finished, it's important to restore the original time by calling `setTestNow()` method without any argument, so it can return the real time.

It's also important to note that, this method should be used sparingly, as it may cause the test to fail in an unexpected way. It is best to only use it when you are trying to debug a specific issue or testing a functionality that is based on time conditions, and then remove it once the issue has been resolved.

Additionally, there are other libraries like `jeremeamia/superclosure` or `laracasts/testdummy` that can be used to fake time in a similar way.

## Testing File Uploads with Storage::fake()

In Laravel, file uploads are typically handled by the `Storage` facade. The `Storage` facade provides methods for interacting with the file system, such as `put()` for uploading files and `get()` for reading files.

When testing file uploads, it is important to use a "fake" file system, so that the test does not actually write or read files from the real file system. Laravel provides the `Storage::fake()` method to do this.

Here is an example of how to use `Storage::fake()` to test file uploads:

```php
use Illuminate\Http\UploadedFile;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;

    public function test_example()
    {
        Storage::fake('public');

        $file = UploadedFile::fake()->create('example.jpg');

        // Perform the file upload
        $response = $this->json('POST', '/upload', [
            'file' => $file
        ]);

        // Assert the file was stored
        Storage::disk('public')->assertExists('example.jpg');

        // Assert the response status
        $response->assertStatus(201);
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Storage::fake('public')` method is used to create a fake file system that uses the "public" disk. The `UploadedFile::fake()->create('example.jpg')` method is used to create a fake file for the test.

The test then performs the file upload by sending a POST request to the "/upload" endpoint with the fake file.

Finally, the test asserts that the file was stored by calling `Storage::disk('public')->assertExists('example.jpg')` and also it asserts that the response status is `201`.

It is important to note that when using `Storage::fake()` method, you should specify the disk you are using, in this case it's the public disk, otherwise, it will use the default disk.

Additionally, `Storage::fake()` method also have `assertMissing`, `allFiles`, `assertExists`, `assertMissing` to assert the fake files and directories.

It's also important to note that, when testing file uploads, it's important to clean up the fake file system after each test by calling `Storage::cleanFake()` method, otherwise, it will cause the test to fail in an unexpected way.

It's also worth noting that, the `Storage::fake()` method only fakes the interaction with the filesystem, but it does not imitate the actual file upload process, you should use the `UploadedFile::fake()` method to simulate an actual file upload.

## Testing Job Dispatching with Bus::fake()

In Laravel, background tasks are typically handled by the `Job` facade. The `Job` facade provides methods for dispatching jobs to a queue, such as `dispatch()` and `dispatchNow()`.

When testing jobs, it is important to use a "fake" queue, so that the test does not actually dispatch jobs to the real queue. Laravel provides the `Bus::fake()` method to do this.

Here is an example of how to use `Bus::fake()` to test job dispatching:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Bus;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;

    public function test_example()
    {
        Bus::fake();

        // Dispatch the job
        dispatch(new ExampleJob());

        // Assert the job was dispatched
        Bus::assertDispatched(ExampleJob::class);
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Bus::fake()` method is used to create a fake queue. The test then dispatches the `ExampleJob` to the queue using the `dispatch()` method.

Finally, the test asserts that the job was dispatched by calling `Bus::assertDispatched(ExampleJob::class)`.

It's also important to note that, when testing job dispatching, it's important to reset the fake queue after each test by calling `Bus::assertNotDispatched()` method, otherwise, it will cause the test to fail in an unexpected way.

Additionally, `Bus::fake()` also have other assertion methods like `assertDispatched`, `assertDispatchedTimes`, `assertNotDispatched`, `assertNothingDispatched` to assert the job dispatching.

## Testing Emails with Mail::fake() and Notification::fake()

In Laravel, emails and notifications are typically handled by the `Mail` and `Notification` facades respectively. The `Mail` facade provides methods for sending emails, such as `send()`, `to()`, and `queue()`. The `Notification` facade provides methods for sending notifications, such as `send()`, `sendNow()`, and `route()`.

When testing emails and notifications, it is important to use a "fake" mailer or notification system, so that the test does not actually send emails or notifications to real recipients. Laravel provides the `Mail::fake()` and `Notification::fake()` methods to do this.

Here is an example of how to use `Mail::fake()` to test email sending:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;

    public function test_example()
    {
        Mail::fake();

        // Send the email
        Mail::to('test@example.com')->send(new ExampleMail());

        // Assert the email was sent
        Mail::assertSent(ExampleMail::class, function ($mail) {
            return $mail->hasTo('test@example.com');
        });
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Mail::fake()` method is used to create a fake mailer. The test then sends the `ExampleMail` to the recipient "[test@example.com](mailto:test@example.com)" using the `to()` and `send()` methods.

Finally, the test asserts that the email was sent by calling `Mail::assertSent(ExampleMail::class)`.

Similarly, here is an example of how to use `Notification::fake()` to test notification sending:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Notification;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;

    public function test_example()
    {
        Notification::fake();

        // Send the notification
        $user = User::first();
        $user->notify(new ExampleNotification());

        // Assert the notification was sent
        Notification::assertSentTo($user, ExampleNotification::class);
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Notification::fake()` method is used to create a fake notification system. The test then sends the `ExampleNotification` to the user using the `notify()` method.

Finally, the test asserts that the notification was sent by calling `Notification::assertSentTo($user, ExampleNotification::class)`.

It's important to note that, when testing email or notifications, it's important to reset the fake mailer or notification system after each test by calling `Mail::assertNothingSent()` or `Notification::assertNothingSent()` method, otherwise, it will cause the test to fail in an unexpected way.

Additionally, `Mail::fake()` and `Notification::fake()` also have other assertion methods like `assertSent`, `assertSentTo`, `assertSentTimes`, `assertNotSent`, `assertNothingSent` to assert the email or notifications sent.

## Testing Events with Event::fake()

In Laravel, events are used to communicate between different parts of the application. The `Event` facade provides methods for firing and listening to events, such as `fire()` and `listen()`.

When testing events, it is important to use a "fake" event system, so that the test does not actually fire events to real listeners. Laravel provides the `Event::fake()` method to do this.

Here is an example of how to use `Event::fake()` to test event firing:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Event;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;

    public function test_example()
    {
        Event::fake();

        // Fire the event
        event(new ExampleEvent());

        // Assert the event was fired
        Event::assertDispatched(ExampleEvent::class);
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Event::fake()` method is used to create a fake event system. The test then fires the `ExampleEvent` using the `event()` function.

Finally, the test asserts that the event was fired by calling `Event::assertDispatched(ExampleEvent::class)`.

It's also important to note that, when testing events, it's important to reset the fake event system after each test by calling `Event::assertNotDispatched()` method, otherwise, it will cause the test to fail in an unexpected way.

Additionally, `Event::fake()` also have other assertion methods like `assertDispatched`, `assertDispatchedTimes`, `assertNotDispatched`, `assertNothingDispatched` to assert the events fired.

It's also worth noting that, you can use the `Event::fake()` method to simulate the events being fired and `Event::assertDispatched()` to check that the correct events were fired. You can also use `Event::assertDispatchedTimes()` to check that the events were fired a specific number of times.

## Fake Packages: Excel::fake() Example

In some cases, it may be necessary to test how a system behaves when interacting with a package that uses external dependencies, such as the `maatwebsite/excel` package for working with Excel files.

To test these scenarios, you can "fake" the package by using a library like `mockery/mockery` or `mockery/mockery-excel` to replace the package's implementation with a custom implementation that returns a specific result during the test.

Here is an example of how to use the `mockery/mockery-excel` library to "fake" the `maatwebsite/excel` package during a test:

```php
use Mockery as m;
use Maatwebsite\Excel\Facades\Excel;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_example()
    {
        // Fake the package
        Excel::fake();

        // Perform the import
        $response = $this->json('POST', '/import', [
            'file' => 'example.xlsx'
        ]);

        // Assert the import was performed
        Excel::assertImported('example.xlsx');

        // Assert the response status
        $response->assertStatus(201);
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Excel::fake()` method is used to create a fake implementation of the `maatwebsite/excel` package. The test then performs the import by sending a POST request to the "/import" endpoint with the file name.

## Fake-Testing 3rd Party External APIs with Http::fake()

In some cases, it may be necessary to test how a system behaves when interacting with external APIs. To test these scenarios, you can "fake" the API response by using a library like `mockery/mockery` or `mockery/mockery-http` to replace the actual API call with a custom response during the test.

Here is an example of how to use the `mockery/mockery-http` library to "fake" a 3rd party external API during a test:

```php
use Mockery as m;
use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use GuzzleHttp\Handler\MockHandler;
use GuzzleHttp\Psr7\Response;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_example()
    {
        // Create a mock response
        $mock = new MockHandler([
            new Response(200, [], '{"data": "example"}'),
        ]);

        // Create a new client with the mock handler
        $client = new Client(['handler' => $mock]);

        // Perform the API call
        $response = $client->get('https://example.com/api/data');

        // Assert the response
        $this->assertEquals(200, $response->getStatusCode());
        $this->assertEquals('{"data": "example"}', $response->getBody());
    }
}
```
In this example, the `MockHandler` class is used to create a fake response that will be returned when the `$client->get()` method is called. The test then performs the API call and asserts that the response is as expected.

It's important to note that, when testing external APIs, it's important to reset the fake response after each test by calling `m::close()` method, otherwise, it will cause the test to fail in an unexpected way.

It's also worth noting that, this method should be used sparingly, as it may cause the test to fail in an unexpected way. It is best to only use it when you are trying to debug a specific issue or testing a functionality that is based on external APIs, and then remove it once the issue has been resolved.

## Fake-Testing 3rd Party External APIs by Mocking Them

When testing systems that interact with external APIs, it can be beneficial to mock the API calls instead of calling the actual API. This allows you to control the response returned by the API and test different scenarios without relying on the availability and behavior of the actual API.

One way to mock external API calls in Laravel is to use a library like `mockery` to create a mock of the API client class. This mock can then be configured to return specific responses for different method calls.

Here is an example of how to use `mockery` to mock an external API client class:

```php
use Mockery;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_example()
    {
        // Create a mock of the API client class
        $mock = Mockery::mock(ApiClient::class);

        // Configure the mock to return a specific response when the getData() method is called
        $mock->shouldReceive('getData')
            ->andReturn(['data' => 'example']);

        // Inject the mock into the system under test
        $system = new SystemUnderTest($mock);

        // Perform the test
        $result = $system->performAction();

        // Assert the result
        $this->assertEquals(['data' => 'example'], $result);
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Mockery::mock()` method is used to create a mock of the `ApiClient` class. The mock is then configured to return a specific response when the `getData()` method is called. The mock is then injected into the system under test and the test is performed.

It's important to note that, when testing systems that interact with external APIs, it's important to reset the mock after each test by calling `Mockery::close()` method, otherwise, it will cause the test to fail in an unexpected way.

It's also worth noting that, this method should be used sparingly, as it may cause the test to fail in an unexpected way. It is best to only use it when you are trying to debug a specific issue or testing a functionality that is based on external APIs, and then remove it once the issue has been resolved.


## No Faking: Test 3rd Party External APIs with Sandbox API Keys

Another approach to testing systems that interact with external APIs, is to use sandbox API keys provided by the API provider. These keys allow you to perform test calls to the API without affecting the production data.

Here is an example of how to use sandbox API keys to test a system that interacts with an external API:

```php
class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_example()
    {
        // Set the API key to the sandbox key
        config(['services.example.key' => 'sandbox_api_key']);

        // Perform the test
        $result = $system->performAction();

        // Assert the result
        $this->assertEquals(['data' => 'example'], $result);

        // Reset the API key to the production key
        config(['services.example.key' => 'production_api_key']);
    }
}
```
In this example, the test sets the API key to the sandbox key before performing the test. The test then asserts that the result is as expected. After the test, the API key is reset to the production key to avoid affecting the production data.

It's important to note that, not all the API providers have the sandbox API keys available for testing, so it's important to check the documentation of the API provider.

It's also worth noting that, sandbox API keys have certain limitations, such as limited data or certain functionalities are not available, so it's important to check the documentation of the API provider to ensure that the test covers all the necessary scenarios.
